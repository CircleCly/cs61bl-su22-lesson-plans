<ins> Before their section - (Discuss these questions with the TA you are observing before their section.) </ins>

What is some things about their teaching that they want you to focus on during this class?

They normally don't ask lots of questions because not many students will be responding and they feel like students prefer listening. So, they want me to focus on her asking more questions to engage students.

What, if any, contextual issues should you keep in mind for this class (e.g. some students dominate the conversation, it's early in the morning, etc)?

Most students don't turn on their cameras. Students usually come in 5 minutes late.

What activities will they do during class? (e.g. Group work? Pair work? Lecture?)

They will start with a mini lecture, and then they will do an exam prep problems. Students will be split into breakout rooms randomly to discuss the problems for 5 minutes. Then students will come back and they will go through the solution. Then students will choose to join breakout rooms with their partners to work on the lab.

<ins> Overall Questions: </ins>

What did they do well?

They are very confident and clear when presenting the concepts of ADTs, also using ``Deque`` as an example of the ADT is a very great choice since it is very relevant to the project and is very relevant to the core concepts of data structures.

What are some areas that could use improvement?

I think during breakout rooms they can join the different breakout rooms and hear students discuss.

Do you have any suggestions for ways they could change their teaching?

Stop more often for questions and ask more guiding questions.

_____ speak in a clear voice that could be easily heard?

_____ Are students comfortable asking "stupid" questions?

_____ Did the students seem willing to answer the TA's questions?

Notes on student participation:

Students seem comfortable asking questions in chat, also, the design of breakout room discussions could encourage student actie learning.

<ins> Focusing on Students </ins>

Did they:

_____ answer student questions with questions?

_____ try to find out what the students knew before giving an explanation?

_____ provide explanations to address both struggling and excelling students?

_____ Did the students seem to understand the TA's explanations?

Notes on how students were acting during class (engaged, enthusiastic, distracted, bored, etc):

Can't say since it's a remote setting, but students seem engaged and active in asking questions.

_____ How often were they on their feet (helping students vs. sitting at the desk)?

_____ What fraction of students did they interact with?

Did they:

_____ interact with the shy students?

_____ refrain from assuming manual control of the keyboard?

Notes on 1-on-1 interactions:

For breakout rooms, they can go around the rooms and check in on the students.
