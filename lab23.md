Today I presented Union Find Sets. I think it went pretty well considering that I spent a lot of time last night to refine the definition of the slides. I also inserted a lot of questions to encourage student active learning - they were able to test and demonstrate understanding of the topics really well.

As for one on ones, I did very good on controlling time and guiding students to an answer. There were a lot of help requests when the lab was over, so I had to turn away some of the tickets to other sections. Overall I did my best to help all the students.
