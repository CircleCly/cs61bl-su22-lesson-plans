**What are the learning goals of the discussion section or lab?**  
  To teach students (probably from scratch) the ideas of asymptotics analysis of programs, (both through iterations and recursions)
  
**Which topic do you predict will be the most difficult for the students to learn?**  
  Analyzing recursion with asymptotics. Conceptual understanding of why we need to use $\Theta$, $\Omega$, and $\text{O}$.
  
  
**What is one thing about your teaching that you want to focus on during this class?**
  To ensure students learn the concept step by step - they need to first get the intuition of "removing the constant and lower order terms", then get to know the formal definition of asymptotics.
  
  
**What activities will you do during class? (e.g. Group work? Pair work? Lecture? Physical demo?)**  
  Lecturing, questioning and answering, lab work.
