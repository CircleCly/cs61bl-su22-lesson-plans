**What are the learning goals of the discussion section or lab?**  

Learn about the different primitive types of Java in programming. Learn about basic object oriented programming concepts (constructors, methods, fields). Learn about box-pointer diagrams for Java primitives and objects.
  
  
**Which topic do you predict will be the most difficult for the students to learn?**  

The syntax might be the most difficult since the ``public`` and ``private`` stuff about Java is different from python. Students may find it hard to adapt. Furthermore, ``static`` and non-``static`` variables/methods might also confuse students.
  
  
**What is one thing about your teaching that you want to focus on during this class?**  

I would like to focus on drawing parallels between Java and Python to help students understand how OOP in Java works. Hopefully if students have taken CS 61A they should find it useful.
  
  
**What activities will you do during class? (e.g. Group work? Pair work? Lecture? Physical demo?)**  

I will mainly be giving lectures. Towards the end of the lecture, I will give the students a practice problem to think about and answer on the spot. (The box-pointer diagram). After the lecture I would be letting students break out into the rooms.

**Presentation**  
  
Did you:

*   speak in a clear voice that could be easily heard?
*   write clearly?
*   listen carefully to students’ comments and questions without interrupting?
*   appear confident?
*   appear enthusiastic?
*   provide clear explanations?
*   explain terminology?

  
**Ideas for improving your presentation:**  
  
  
**Classroom Climate**  
  
Did you:

*   address students of all genders equally?
*   address students of different ethnic groups equally?
*   address shy and forthcoming students equally?
*   feel like students were generally happy (e.g. no angry students)?
*   take the time to learn your students’ names?

  
**Ideas for improving the classroom climate:**  
  
  
**Student Participation**  

*   Are students comfortable interacting with you?
*   Are the students comfortable interacting with each other?
*   How often were you talking versus the students?
*   Did you encourage the students to ask questions?
*   Are students comfortable asking “stupid” questions?
*   Were you happy with how long it took for students to answer your questions?
*   Did the students seem interested and engaged?

  
**Ideas for improving student participation:**  
  
  
**Focusing on Students**  
  
Did you:

*   try to answer a student’s question with a question?
*   try to find out what the students knew before giving an explanation?
*   provide explanations to address both struggling and excelling students?
*   feel like students understood your explanations?
*   feel like students, in general, really understand with the material?

  
**Ideas for tailoring your teaching to the needs of your students:**  
  
  
**Lab/1-on-1 Interactions**  
  
You may skip any questions that are not applicable.  

*   What fraction of students did you interact with?

*   Did you interact with the shy students?
*   Did you refrain from assuming manual control of the keyboard?
