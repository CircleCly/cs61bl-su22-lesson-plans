**What are the learning goals of the discussion section or lab?**  
  The concept of binary search trees. Insertion, deletion, query, etc.
  
**Which topic do you predict will be the most difficult for the students to learn?**  
  Deletion since there's a lot of details to check.
  
**What is one thing about your teaching that you want to focus on during this class?**  
  Time keeping - refrain from spending too much time answer specific questions.
  
**What activities will you do during class? (e.g. Group work? Pair work? Lecture? Physical demo?)**  
  Zoom polls, lecturing.

**First things first I’m the realest**  
  
**What went really well today? :)**  
  Explanations of the binary search trees are very smooth. Also I was able to answer the student questions effectively.

  Furthermore I think I did much better on pacing my mini-lectures and left ample time for students to work on lab & ask questions!
  
**What didn’t go so well?**  
  I am aware that I tend to insert "basically" a lot in my lecturing.
  
**Ideas for improving your presentation:**  
  Instead of saying basically, just remove it entirely.
  
**Ideas for improving the classroom climate:**  
  Not for now.
  
**Ideas for improving student participation:**  
  I think the guiding questions are very inspiring (using guessing game to 
  introduce to idea of binary search) so just keep those up.
  
**Ideas for tailoring your teaching to the needs of your students:**  
  Keep up the good work.
  
**Ideas to improve 1-on-1 interactions:**  
  There was once when I tried to help a student realize he could write a helper method for a recursive method when the current method signature is not what he wanted. I tried not directly giving him the answer but he seems quite confused.
  
  I feel like since this is more of a paradigm it might be more useful to just show them the paradigm (maybe a different example).
