**What are the learning goals of the discussion section or lab?**  
  The goal is to introduce students to how to use Comparables, Iterators, and Iterables; students will also get
  to know how to handle Exceptions.
  
**Which topic do you predict will be the most difficult for the students to learn?**  
  The idea of iterator may be intimidating since people might have flashbacks about ``yield`` and generators in CS 61A and python.
  And, as always, syntax can be weird.
  
**What is one thing about your teaching that you want to focus on during this class?**  
  I'd like to focus on making my explanations more concise and pace up my mini-lectures a bit (since they were
  comparatively long)
  
**What activities will you do during class? (e.g. Group work? Pair work? Lecture? Physical demo?)**  
  Mini-lectures, exam-prep breakout room discussions and explanations, lab work.

**First things first I’m the realest**  
  
**What went really well today? :)**  
  I did much better at timing compared with yesterday. I felt that I spent fewer time talking and gave students more time to work on the lab.

  Although I still cough quite a bit, I now bring plenty of water to drink, so whenever I feel uncomfortable, I just drink water.
  
**What didn’t go so well?**  
  There were some audio issues which I'm not sure why happened. Furthermore, When I did one on one the eduroam at Soda 277 network betrayed on me and made me could not hear one student. However this did not have too much of an impact on my mini-lecture.
  
**Ideas for improving your presentation:**  
  Keep the trick of drinking water if you are coughing.

**Ideas for improving the classroom climate:**  
  Keep up the good work!
  
**Ideas for improving student participation:**  
  Today's content was a bit bland and not much place for students to ask questions. Moving into the more conceptual stuff, I will give students more guiding questions. Exam prep was great today so I should keep letting students discuss exam prep questions.
  
**Ideas for tailoring your teaching to the needs of your students:**  
  I feel like the idea of putting an optional demo for iterators is quite useful for students, and it also saves students time.
  
  
**Lab/1-on-1 Interactions**  
  
You may skip any questions that are not applicable.  

*   What fraction of students did you interact with? Most students. However not a lot came because the lab was easy & some of them skipped lab because they knew they have the recordings.

*   Did you interact with the shy students? Yes. 
*   Did you refrain from assuming manual control of the keyboard? Yes.

  
**Ideas to improve 1-on-1 interactions:**  
  Troubleshoot the audio & network issue.
