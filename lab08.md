<ins>Before your section</ins>  
  
**What are the learning goals of the discussion section or lab?**  
  To introduce students to the idea of persistence (string vs object io), and to prepare students for Gitlet.
  
**Which topic do you predict will be the most difficult for the students to learn?**  
  The syntax of the ``Utils.join``, the fact that a java File object does not create the file
  but instead acts like a pointer to a file.
  
  
**What is one thing about your teaching that you want to focus on during this class?**  
  To make students understand how the Utils.join syntax is used in actual coding through demonstrations.
  
**What activities will you do during class? (e.g. Group work? Pair work? Lecture? Physical demo?)**  
  Poll, lecturing, demo-ing, lab breakout work.
  
<ins>Immediately after your section</ins>  
  
**First things first I’m the realest**  
  
**What went really well today? :)**  
  The demo was pretty extensive and covered a lot of concepts.
  
**What didn’t go so well?**  
  Interaction became less since it was mainly me showing the code, also I think I went longer
  than usual for the mini-lecture.
  
**Presentation**  
  
Did you:

*   speak in a clear voice that could be easily heard?
*   write clearly?
*   listen carefully to students’ comments and questions without interrupting?
*   appear confident?
*   appear enthusiastic?
*   provide clear explanations?
*   explain terminology?

  
**Ideas for improving your presentation:**  
  Today I could have appeared more confident and more definitive in giving statements about the program.
  
**Classroom Climate**  
  
Did you:

*   address students of all genders equally?
*   address students of different ethnic groups equally?
*   address shy and forthcoming students equally?
*   feel like students were generally happy (e.g. no angry students)?
*   take the time to learn your students’ names?

  
**Ideas for improving the classroom climate:**  
  Keep up the good work!
  
**Student Participation**  

*   Are students comfortable interacting with you?
*   Are the students comfortable interacting with each other?
*   How often were you talking versus the students?
*   Did you encourage the students to ask questions?
*   Are students comfortable asking “stupid” questions?
*   Were you happy with how long it took for students to answer your questions?
*   Did the students seem interested and engaged?

  
**Ideas for improving student participation:**  
  Students were very comfortable asking questions and I did a good job
  responding to those.
  
**Focusing on Students**  
  
Did you:

*   try to answer a student’s question with a question?
*   try to find out what the students knew before giving an explanation?
*   provide explanations to address both struggling and excelling students?
*   feel like students understood your explanations?
*   feel like students, in general, really understand with the material?

  
**Ideas for tailoring your teaching to the needs of your students:**  
  I'd say today's demo might be long (a specific example of the serialization following pointers), so for these type of demos
  I should probably just say "I'll be staying in the main room presenting this, while those of you
  who want to split off for partner work can do so")
  
**Lab/1-on-1 Interactions**  
  
You may skip any questions that are not applicable.  

*   What fraction of students did you interact with? Most students.

*   Did you interact with the shy students? Yes.
*   Did you refrain from assuming manual control of the keyboard? Yes.

  
**Ideas to improve 1-on-1 interactions:**  
    Keep up asking guiding questions!
