<ins> Before their section - (Discuss these questions with the TA you are observing before their section.) </ins>

What is some things about their teaching that they want you to focus on during this class?

Today she will make the mini lecture shorter because today is project 2 due date, so she wants to give students a little bit more time to work on the project.

What, if any, contextual issues should you keep in mind for this class (e.g. some students dominate the conversation, it's early in the morning, etc)?

There might be less people today because many of them are working on the project. And there are two to three students are the ones that are most active and always ask questions in the chat.

What activities will they do during class? (e.g. Group work? Pair work? Lecture?)

Only a mini lecture at the beginning, and then go through a few exam prep problems together. Then students will be sent to breakout rooms to work on the lab and project.

<ins> Overall Questions: </ins>

What did they do well?

She did very well on controlling the time of lecturing and giving students more time to work on Gitlet. She covered all important concepts and was able to stop at times to ask if students have any questions (even though there seems to be not any). There were also more people that attended her section than expected (~22 I think?).

What are some areas that could use improvement?

Although teaching style is up to one's personal preference, she could try to insert a bit of memes/jokes to keep the students engaged.

Another thing she could do is to make use of sanity check questions to let students answer (like in the slides there was one "Poll: which bucket would this go into?). Again, this might not be 100% applicable since her section's students might get inactive and not respond, but I do think encouraging student active learning would be helpful.

Do you have any suggestions for ways they could change their teaching?

Yeah basically the same as what I discussed above - humor (when you feel comfortable doing so), and use interactive questions.

<ins> Presentation </ins>

Did they:

_____ speak in a clear voice that could be easily heard?

_____ make eye contact with the class?

_____ write clearly?

_____ listen carefully to students' comments and questions without interrupting?

_____ appear confident?

_____ appear enthusiastic?

_____ provide clear explanations?

_____ explain terminology?

Notes on their presentation:

Explanations were to-the-point and very clear, and covered all points that have to do with HashMaps and Hash Functions.

<ins> Classroom Climate </ins>

Did they:

_____ call on/address students by name uniformly at random?

_____ take time to learn students' names? (Important!)

Notes on classroom climate:

This was not an issue.

<ins> Student Participation </ins>

_____ Are students comfortable interacting with the TA?

_____ Are the students comfortable interacting with each other?

_____ (Answer with percentages) How often was your partner talking? The students talking?

_____ Did they encourage the students to ask questions?

_____ Are students comfortable asking "stupid" questions?

_____ Did the students seem willing to answer the TA's questions?

_____ Did the students seem interested and engaged?

Notes on student participation:

A lot of students went in to her mini-lecture. However I don't think students have a lot of questions (elaborated below).

<ins> Focusing on Students </ins>

Did they:

_____ answer student questions with questions?

_____ try to find out what the students knew before giving an explanation?

_____ provide explanations to address both struggling and excelling students?

_____ Did the students seem to understand the TA's explanations?

Notes on how students were acting during class (engaged, enthusiastic, distracted, bored, etc):

Students do not have a lot of questions. It could be that the idea of hashing is kind of intuitive to grasp. (Or maybe it's
just a thing about online sections where people just not participate).

<ins> Lab/1-on-1 Interactions </ins>

_____ How often were they on their feet (helping students vs. sitting at the desk)?

_____ What fraction of students did they interact with?

Did they:

_____ interact with the shy students?

_____ refrain from assuming manual control of the keyboard?

Notes on 1-on-1 interactions:

She's doing great on helping out individual students!
