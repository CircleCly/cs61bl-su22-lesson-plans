Today's Project 2 Workday. I didn't not expect so few students to come at the start, but without AIs it's kind of overwhelming to go through all those help requests about Gitlet.

I did pretty good on cutting the time on each student and giving them specific things to do (like at 20 min mark I say read this part of spec and draw diagrams of what this is doing, or just complete this conceptual check).

I also did a good job on listening to students first and then suggesting changes, rather than jumping to a conclusion on student code.

I did sometimes get a bit frustrated at students "not getting" the point of some commands, but for the most part I kept those emotions in check. With my explanation and my consideration of the student's point of view, the students were able to get it.
