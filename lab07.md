<ins>Before your section</ins>  
  
**What are the learning goals of the discussion section or lab?**  
  To introduce to students the idea of interfaces and abstract data types.
  
**Which topic do you predict will be the most difficult for the students to learn?**  
  I think students may find it difficult to understand why we need interfacts in the first place.
  They might also feel intimidated by the number of methods in the List, Map, Set ADTs.
  
**What is one thing about your teaching that you want to focus on during this class?**  
  To use demos to explain to students the idea of having interfaces.
  
**What activities will you do during class? (e.g. Group work? Pair work? Lecture? Physical demo?)**  
  Lecturing, code demo, breakout room exam-prep discussion.

**First things first I’m the realest**  
  
**What went really well today? :)**  
  The demo went really well and was to the point.
  Also did not attempt to solve things on the fly during exam prep.
  
**What didn’t go so well?**  
  Made a mistake when I said ``entrySet()`` was a set of all values (but corrected later).
  
**Presentation**  
  
Did you:

*   speak in a clear voice that could be easily heard?
*   write clearly?
*   listen carefully to students’ comments and questions without interrupting?
*   appear confident?
*   appear enthusiastic?
*   provide clear explanations?
*   explain terminology?

  
**Ideas for improving your presentation:**  
  When appropriate, use more demos!
  
**Classroom Climate**  
  
Did you:

*   address students of all genders equally?
*   address students of different ethnic groups equally?
*   address shy and forthcoming students equally?
*   feel like students were generally happy (e.g. no angry students)?
*   take the time to learn your students’ names?

  
**Ideas for improving the classroom climate:**  
  Keep up the work so far! Students were generally comfortable during sessions.
  
**Student Participation**  

*   Are students comfortable interacting with you?
*   Are the students comfortable interacting with each other?
*   How often were you talking versus the students?
*   Did you encourage the students to ask questions?
*   Are students comfortable asking “stupid” questions?
*   Were you happy with how long it took for students to answer your questions?
*   Did the students seem interested and engaged?

  
**Ideas for improving student participation:**  
  Students were very eager to ask and answer questions during the class, so I would say keep using breakout rooms
  and keep asking engaging questions.
  
**Focusing on Students**  
  
Did you:

*   try to answer a student’s question with a question?
*   try to find out what the students knew before giving an explanation?
*   provide explanations to address both struggling and excelling students?
*   feel like students understood your explanations?
*   feel like students, in general, really understand with the material?

  
**Ideas for tailoring your teaching to the needs of your students:**  
  I think I did well on this part today.
  
**Lab/1-on-1 Interactions**  
  
You may skip any questions that are not applicable.  

*   What fraction of students did you interact with? Most of the students.

*   Did you interact with the shy students? Yes.
*   Did you refrain from assuming manual control of the keyboard? Yes.

  
**Ideas to improve 1-on-1 interactions:**  
  Use more examples, ask more what the student think the answer is.
