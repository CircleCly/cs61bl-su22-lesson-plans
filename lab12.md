**First things first I’m the realest**  
  
**What went really well today? :)**  
  Explanations to problems are pretty clear, and even though I weren't able to go through all problems I prepared in the allocated time slot, I told my students that there will be optional walkthrough in the main room for the rest of the problems.
  
  
**What didn’t go so well?**  
  Mind went blank for a sec when walking through one problem, so don't know what to say. Fortunately quickly referred to my notes with solutions on it and picked up.

  Also I realized that I should have used more visualizations in explaining the asymptotics.
  
  
**Ideas for improving your presentation:**  
  Try to speak a bit faster? Also when answering student questions if I repeat less I can sound more confident - and I can save more time as well.
  
**Ideas for improving the classroom climate:**  
  Not an issue here.
  
**Ideas for improving student participation:**  
  I think keep up the great variety of different activities - polls, breakout rooms, etc.
  
**Ideas for tailoring your teaching to the needs of your students:**  
  Keep up the good work so far!
  
**Ideas to improve 1-on-1 interactions:**  
  Draw more diagrams when necessary.
