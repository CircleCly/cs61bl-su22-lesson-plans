Today I presented Dijkstra's and A*. Students are doing fine on Dijkstra's but they are confused about the point of having a heuristic about A*. There was one student who asked quite a lot of questions when I went over the demo, but I had to say "We'll move on, if you have questions let's talk once breakout rooms are open". I think that's a good thing to do since I don't want to break the flow of my presentation just for one student. And as it turns out, while we are walking through the exam prep problem at the end, I was able to clear up his confusion by step-by-step analysis.

As for helping students, I think I did a pretty good job at answering and guiding them, however I wasn't able to get through all tickets, since there are so many of them. Had to reject tickets created after the class ends because I don't really want to make staying overtime a habit.

In general today a lot of things were a bit hectic, but I did my best to overcome these so I'm still pretty satisfied.
