**What are the learning goals of the discussion section or lab?**  

Learn about the basic ideas of a Linked List, as well as what improvements the 61B linked list have compared with 61A linked lists (access modifiers, abstraction, inner classes, etc.)
  
**Which topic do you predict will be the most difficult for the students to learn?**  

I think the point of having the abstraction barrier might be difficult. Also the students may be scared of linked lists since they might have heard it elsewhere that it's difficult and hard.
  
**What is one thing about your teaching that you want to focus on during this class?**  

I will focus on engaging student active learning through this lab section. Through answering questions and discussing with a partner, I would like students to have a mental representation of the linked lists by drawing box and pointer diagrams, and I would also like students to understand why we need abstraction. Students should then be able to apply the skills of linked lists to write more methods that operate on the nodes.
  
**What activities will you do during class? (e.g. Group work? Pair work? Lecture? Physical demo?)**  
Intro poll, pair work, Q&A, lab work.

**Presentation**

*   write clearly?
*   listen carefully to students’ comments and questions without interrupting?
*   appear confident?
*   appear enthusiastic?
*   provide clear explanations?
*   explain terminology?

**Classroom Climate**  
  
Did you:

*   address students of all genders equally?
*   address students of different ethnic groups equally?
*   address shy and forthcoming students equally?
*   feel like students were generally happy (e.g. no angry students)?
*   take the time to learn your students’ names?

  
**Ideas for improving the classroom climate:**  
  
  
**Student Participation**  

*   Are students comfortable interacting with you?
*   Are the students comfortable interacting with each other?
*   How often were you talking versus the students?
*   Did you encourage the students to ask questions?
*   Are students comfortable asking “stupid” questions?
*   Were you happy with how long it took for students to answer your questions?
*   Did the students seem interested and engaged?

  
**Ideas for improving student participation:**  
  
  
**Focusing on Students**  
  
Did you:

*   try to answer a student’s question with a question?
*   try to find out what the students knew before giving an explanation?
*   provide explanations to address both struggling and excelling students?
*   feel like students understood your explanations?
*   feel like students, in general, really understand with the material?

  
**Ideas for tailoring your teaching to the needs of your students:**  
  
  
**Lab/1-on-1 Interactions**  
  
You may skip any questions that are not applicable.  

*   What fraction of students did you interact with?

*   Did you interact with the shy students?
*   Did you refrain from assuming manual control of the keyboard?
