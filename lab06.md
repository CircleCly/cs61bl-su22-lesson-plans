**What are the learning goals of the discussion section or lab?**  
  To continue explanation on Linked List. This time we'll cover doubly-linked lists, faster
  size() and addBack() operations. We'll also cover sentinels and generics.
  
**Which topic do you predict will be the most difficult for the students to learn?** 
  I think the idea of a sentinel might be convoluted since a sentinel does not actually hold any value.
  Furthermore, the box-pointer diagram of DLLists with sentinels looks rather scary.
  
**What is one thing about your teaching that you want to focus on during this class?**  
  I will focus on active learning - I will use questions, polls, and discussions to make sure students engage with
  the material.
  
  
**What activities will you do during class? (e.g. Group work? Pair work? Lecture? Physical demo?)**  
  Intro poll, mini-lecture, question poll, breakout room discussion.

**First things first I’m the realest**  
  
**What went really well today? :)**  
  The polls and student participation are decent today, students were eager to answer questions.
  During one-on-ones I did generally a good job in clearing up student confusions. 
  
  
**What didn’t go so well?**  
  During one-on-ones towards the end I got tired (because later I discovered that I got a fever, sad ;( )
  Also for a recursion problem, I should have walked them through the visualizer rather than try to draw the
  diagrams myself - my drawings were sometimes confusing and I made mistakes.
**Presentation**  
  
Did you:

*   speak in a clear voice that could be easily heard?
*   write clearly?
*   listen carefully to students’ comments and questions without interrupting?
*   appear confident?
*   appear enthusiastic?
*   provide clear explanations?
*   explain terminology?

  
**Ideas for improving your presentation:**  
  I think I should just keep my current lecture pace - makes it easier for students to absorb content
  There was one time that my mic was too close to my mouth so students say they heard me breathing, I should probably pay attention to this issue in later labs.
  
**Classroom Climate**  
  
Did you:

*   address students of all genders equally?
*   address students of different ethnic groups equally?
*   address shy and forthcoming students equally?
*   feel like students were generally happy (e.g. no angry students)?
*   take the time to learn your students’ names?

  
**Ideas for improving the classroom climate:**  
  This was not an issue.
  
**Student Participation**  

*   Are students comfortable interacting with you?
*   Are the students comfortable interacting with each other?
*   How often were you talking versus the students?
*   Did you encourage the students to ask questions?
*   Are students comfortable asking “stupid” questions?
*   Were you happy with how long it took for students to answer your questions?
*   Did the students seem interested and engaged?

  
**Ideas for improving student participation:**  
  I think I should keep on asking students to share their line of thought.
  
**Focusing on Students**  
  
Did you:

*   try to answer a student’s question with a question?
*   try to find out what the students knew before giving an explanation?
*   provide explanations to address both struggling and excelling students?
*   feel like students understood your explanations?
*   feel like students, in general, really understand with the material?

  
**Ideas for tailoring your teaching to the needs of your students:**  
  Most times Java visualizer can be more useful than hand-drawing.
  
**Lab/1-on-1 Interactions**  
  
You may skip any questions that are not applicable.  

*   What fraction of students did you interact with? Most students.

*   Did you interact with the shy students? Yes.
*   Did you refrain from assuming manual control of the keyboard? Yes.

  
**Ideas to improve 1-on-1 interactions:**  
  Use the right tool, if it took too long, say "This is confusing indeed, but I'll get back to you later."
