<ins>Before your section</ins>  
  
**What are the learning goals of the discussion section or lab?**  
  To introduce students to the ideas of trees, binary trees, pre/in/post-order traversals, and depth/breadth first traversals of trees.
  
**Which topic do you predict will be the most difficult for the students to learn?**  
  Breadth first search is kind of counterintuitive because it does not use a recursive structure.
  
**What is one thing about your teaching that you want to focus on during this class?**  
  To show students visualizations about the algorithms.
  
**What activities will you do during class? (e.g. Group work? Pair work? Lecture? Physical demo?)**  
  Interactive sanity check questions and lecturing.
  
  
<ins>Immediately after your section</ins>  
  
**First things first I’m the realest**  
  
**What went really well today? :)**  
  Didn't use a lot of filler words today.
  Students laughed at the joke I made about my grade school experience that is similar to stacks.
  
**What didn’t go so well?**  
  Spent more time than I expencted on breadth-first search and breaking down the skeleton code because students still felt confused when I did the initial explanation.
  
**Ideas for improving your presentation:**  
  Keep up the presentation flow.
  
**Ideas for improving the classroom climate:**  
  None!
  
**Ideas for improving student participation:**  
  Didn't prepare a lot of interactive problems so maybe some next time?
  
**Ideas for tailoring your teaching to the needs of your students:**  
  None!
  
**Ideas to improve 1-on-1 interactions:**  
  None!
