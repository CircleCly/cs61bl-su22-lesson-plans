**What are the learning goals of the discussion section or lab?**  
  
This discussion section helps students to setup their working environment for the rest of the course and teaches students about the basic concepts of Java and Git.

**Which topic do you predict will be the most difficult for the students to learn?**  

I think the idea of Git is the most difficult for students to learn because the language of "add", "commit", and "push" sound counterintuitive and alien to students. The concepts of version control may also not be something that students have been aware of, so it is something that will take longer for students to absorb.
  
**What is one thing about your teaching that you want to focus on during this class?**  

I want to focus on improving student confidence during the class. Even though the concepts of Git and Java can seem daunting, I would be telling them "if you don't get it now, you can first take it for granted, and as we go deeper into the content, you will suddenly realize what's going on". The idea is to make students believe they have the "locus of control", which improves student performance.
  
**What activities will you do during class? (e.g. Group work? Pair work? Lecture? Physical demo?)**  

I would start with an icebreaker that introduces students to each other. Have name, year, pronouns, major, and date of birth (will tell them to sort themselves in ascending order). This icebreaker may be able to pique their interest in sorting.

Then I will head off into a mini-lecture, explaining the steps of install briefly, but focusing more on the basic concept of Java and the basic concept of Git.

Then I will hand it over to students in breakout rooms, where they can pair themselves freely and have me or other AIs answer their questions.

**First things first I’m the realest**  
  
**What went really well today? :)**  

The icebreaker went really well and it was a lot of fun. I think I managed to let students get to know each other. I also did a good job in 1-on-1 helping with students and discussing with AIs.
  
**What didn’t go so well?**  

I think there are some logistical issues that I did not emphasize enough - the OH queue tool as the preferred way of getting help in section, for instance. This resulted in students keep asking me in Zoom (rather than using the OH queue tool).
  
**Presentation**  
  
Did you:

*   speak in a clear voice that could be easily heard?
*   write clearly?
*   listen carefully to students’ comments and questions without interrupting?
*   appear confident?
*   appear enthusiastic?
*   provide clear explanations?
*   explain terminology?

  
**Ideas for improving your presentation:**  
  I think I did most questions well, but for once I interrupted students while he was explaining his situation for me. He was explaining that he sees the "password deprecated" window on git, and then I just assumed that he needed help and started telling him what to do. However, he then said he actually figured it out. I should listen to students and wait for them to finish their statement of problem in the future.
  
**Classroom Climate**  
  
Did you:

*   address students of all genders equally?
*   address students of different ethnic groups equally?
*   address shy and forthcoming students equally?
*   feel like students were generally happy (e.g. no angry students)?
*   take the time to learn your students’ names?

  
**Ideas for improving the classroom climate:**  
I think I maintained a good classroom climate, in general. Students were generally happy.
  
**Student Participation**  

*   Are students comfortable interacting with you?
*   Are the students comfortable interacting with each other?
*   How often were you talking versus the students?
*   Did you encourage the students to ask questions?
*   Are students comfortable asking “stupid” questions?
*   Were you happy with how long it took for students to answer your questions?
*   Did the students seem interested and engaged?

  
**Ideas for improving student participation:**  
  For the icebreaker though, they were interested and participated through chat.

  Most of this part went really well. It was a remote section so there were not a lot of student interactions. However, I did open up breakout rooms for them to pair up with their free will, and managed to pair students who want but do not have a partner up. 

  The students were also comfortable asking "stupid" questions for a couple of times.
  
**Focusing on Students**  
  
Did you:

*   try to answer a student’s question with a question?
*   try to find out what the students knew before giving an explanation?
*   provide explanations to address both struggling and excelling students?
*   feel like students understood your explanations?
*   feel like students, in general, really understand with the material?

  
**Ideas for tailoring your teaching to the needs of your students:**  
  I think this part also went quite well. Since this lab is about computer setup, I gave to them on-point explanations about what was wrong. Also when a student was asking about how Java programs handle the runtime arguments, I also explained to him clearly what it means.

  I could be more inspirational in later labs, but this is a lab where there's not a lot of "whys" can be asked, since it is about rigid setup.
  
**Lab/1-on-1 Interactions**  
  
You may skip any questions that are not applicable.  

*   What fraction of students did you interact with? Most of them, during checkoff.

*   Did you interact with the shy students? Yes.

*   Did you refrain from assuming manual control of the keyboard? Yes. Only told them what to do, not tried to control them.

  
**Ideas to improve 1-on-1 interactions:**  
  Try to listen until the student finishes their sentence.
