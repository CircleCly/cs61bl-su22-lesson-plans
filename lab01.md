**What are the learning goals of the discussion section or lab?**  
  
This discussion section helps students to setup their working environment for the rest of the course and teaches students about the basic concepts of Java and Git.

**Which topic do you predict will be the most difficult for the students to learn?**  

I think the idea of Git is the most difficult for students to learn because the language of "add", "commit", and "push" sound counterintuitive and alien to students. The concepts of version control may also not be something that students have been aware of, so it is something that will take longer for students to absorb.
  
**What is one thing about your teaching that you want to focus on during this class?**  

I want to focus on improving student confidence during the class. Even though the concepts of Git and Java can seem daunting, I would be telling them "if you don't get it now, you can first take it for granted, and as we go deeper into the content, you will suddenly realize what's going on". The idea is to make students believe they have the "locus of control", which improves student performance.
  
**What activities will you do during class? (e.g. Group work? Pair work? Lecture? Physical demo?)**  

I would start with an icebreaker that introduces students to each other. Have name, year, pronouns, major, and date of birth (will tell them to sort themselves in ascending order). This icebreaker may be able to pique their interest in sorting.

Then I will head off into a mini-lecture, explaining the steps of install briefly, but focusing more on the basic concept of Java and the basic concept of Git.

Then I will hand it over to students in breakout rooms, where they can pair themselves freely and have me or other AIs answer their questions.

**Focusing on Students**  
  
Did you:

*   try to answer a student’s question with a question?

**Lab/1-on-1 Interactions**  
  
You may skip any questions that are not applicable.  

*   What fraction of students did you interact with?

*   Did you interact with the shy students?
*   Did you refrain from assuming manual control of the keyboard?
