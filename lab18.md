Today we discussed about HashMaps. I feel that students' interest was piqued by the "hashbrown patty" image lol.

The lecture was pretty smooth and I was able to ask students thought-provoking questions - like whether hash collisions could be avoided entirely, etc. The sanity check questions were also able to let students stay on track.

I also did pretty good on pacing and decided to make exam-prep optional in the main room. Students have ample time for working on the lab.

For one-on-ones, students ask a lot about Gitlet debugging because the deadline is near. I think I did very good on giving students specific things to do when I realize I'm spending way too much time. However, I do think I'm staying quite long after the section - mine ends at 2PM but I started helping them at 1:58PM, didn't finish after 2:40PM. Maybe I can just cut it short and give them general advice when it becomes too long? But overall, today's pretty good.
