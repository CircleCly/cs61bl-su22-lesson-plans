Today I didn't present lab material because I let an Academic Intern took over the presentation for me. However I did do 1-on-1 with the students.

**Ideas to improve 1-on-1 interactions:**  
  For debugging, first try to walkthrough the student's design before coming to any judgements about their code. The same also applies to lab - first ask what they are trying to achieve.
