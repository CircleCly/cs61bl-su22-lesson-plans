There's like 7 AIs in my section and today another AI presented the bulk on the conceptual review. I did do two sections though: announcements and lab walkthrough. For lab walkthrough, I did refer to the lab spec more closely by actually navigating to the lab spec and highlight specific parts of the spec(since in one of the class surveys students pointed out doing this might be more helpful).

For one-on-ones, I am doing much better at controlling my time and understanding student questions first. However, I feel like I could do better at guiding students - it's really hard to strike the balance between "nudging" and "giving them the answer. If I just ask guiding questions sometimes they are just not following. However I couldn't just go ahead and give them the answer. 

Maybe this is something that gets better as time goes by, but I definitely want to continue practicing this.
