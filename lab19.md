Today was an intro to the Project 3 - Build Your Own World. I did some demoing of the code, playing around with options that generate a variety of blocks in the game. 

The lab was two-part: first part is world building, and second part is a memory game that teaches students about user interactivity. Students seemed to grasp the idea of how to create shapes, etc., and although some of them struggled with how to read keystrokes, I was able to draw a flow chart with them and analyze the flow of the program with them.

I didn't have a lot of issues debugging student code today and went through the tickets quite quickly. I wish every lab could be like this ;)
