**What are the learning goals of the discussion section or lab?**  
To learn how to use the debugger in IntelliJ, and to learn about the basic
ideas of Test Driven Development (TDD).
  
**Which topic do you predict will be the most difficult for the students to learn?**  
The different types of debugger commands, as well as when to use them (step into, step over, etc.).
  
**What is one thing about your teaching that you want to focus on during this class?**  
I want to focus on the demos. I plan on using two snippets of code to demonstrate the functionalities 
of the Java Debugger. I also plan on show how to code a problem from scratch (with students coming up
with test cases).
  
**What activities will you do during class? (e.g. Group work? Pair work? Lecture? Physical demo?)**  
Lecturing, test-case designing.

**First things first I’m the realest**  
  
**What went really well today? :)**  
The demo was very effective in terms of showing students what IntelliJ debugging is able to do. Also I
went at a slower pace today, so the students have more time to grasp what the different commands of debugging
can do.

The example was also very effective in demonstrating TDD: I wrote a problem about computing n choose k, and students came up with edge cases and normal cases. The example was also not that hard to understand, so I felt it appropriate.

  
**What didn’t go so well?**  
Today I decided to record myself so I guess I was more nervous.
  
  
**Presentation**  
  
Did you:

*   speak in a clear voice that could be easily heard?
*   write clearly?
*   listen carefully to students’ comments and questions without interrupting?
*   appear confident?
*   appear enthusiastic?
*   provide clear explanations?
*   explain terminology?

  
**Ideas for improving your presentation:**  
Keep about the same pace - the speed was pretty good today for content absorb. Also I did a much
better job on listening carefully to students' comments, by usually encouraging the student to explain
his/her solution. 
  
**Classroom Climate**  
  
Did you:

*   address students of all genders equally?
*   address students of different ethnic groups equally?
*   address shy and forthcoming students equally?
*   feel like students were generally happy (e.g. no angry students)?
*   take the time to learn your students’ names?

  
**Ideas for improving the classroom climate:**  
Again, this was not much of an issue.
  
**Student Participation**  

*   Are students comfortable interacting with you?
*   Are the students comfortable interacting with each other?
*   How often were you talking versus the students?
*   Did you encourage the students to ask questions?
*   Are students comfortable asking “stupid” questions?
*   Were you happy with how long it took for students to answer your questions?
*   Did the students seem interested and engaged?

  
**Ideas for improving student participation:**  
I think there are some points where I should have stopped and asked "any questions" - the beginning
logistics part, for example. Also, I forgot from time to time to reply "great question" to keep students
encouraged to ask questions.
  
**Focusing on Students**  
  
Did you:

*   try to answer a student’s question with a question?
*   try to find out what the students knew before giving an explanation?
*   provide explanations to address both struggling and excelling students?
*   feel like students understood your explanations?
*   feel like students, in general, really understand with the material?

  
**Ideas for tailoring your teaching to the needs of your students:**  
I think I also tried to help a student during 1-on-1 sessions using Chinese since she is more comfortable
using that language. She was having trouble grasping the tilt method of the 2048 project and the switch
of language eased this quite a bit for her.
  
**Lab/1-on-1 Interactions**  
  
You may skip any questions that are not applicable.  

*   What fraction of students did you interact with? I thinik 1/3 since not a lot of people submit help requests.

*   Did you interact with the shy students? Yes. 

*   Did you refrain from assuming manual control of the keyboard? Yes.

  
**Ideas to improve 1-on-1 interactions:**  
If a student is keeping me too long, try to think about specific things for them to do as Peyrin mentioned in last
reflection. This could be "draw out what the board is supposed to be like", for instance.
