<ins>Before your section</ins>  
  
**What are the learning goals of the discussion section or lab?**  
  Balanced BSTs - Red black trees.
  
**Which topic do you predict will be the most difficult for the students to learn?**  
  All of it is quite challenging (B-trees, red-black tree) and requires a lot of visualizations.
  
**What is one thing about your teaching that you want to focus on during this class?**  
  I'll be focusing on getting the visualizations right.
  
**What activities will you do during class? (e.g. Group work? Pair work? Lecture? Physical demo?)**  
  Mini-lecture, zoom poll, exam prep question.

**What went really well today? :)**  
  Explanation went quite smooth and the visualizations are good illustrative material.

  Also today's pace and timing went quite well.
  
**What didn’t go so well?**  
  There were a lot more help requests than usual so I felt I got a little bit tired towards the end.

**Ideas for tailoring your teaching to the needs of your students:**  
  From last time's survey, some people disliked breakout rooms so today I did not use breakout room format when introducing the exam-prep problem.
  
**Ideas to improve 1-on-1 interactions:**  
  When students ask for how to write a constructor & how to use recursion on this problem, restrain the urge to just give them the answer and instead guide them to how recursion works.
