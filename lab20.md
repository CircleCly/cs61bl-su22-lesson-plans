Today I had another AI do presentation about Heaps and Priority queues so I didn't present myself. The AI's doing fantastic and the pacing was great. For one-on-ones, I should try to finish up my section by 2 and politely ask students to find help somewhere else (especially when these students are asking about Gitlet which was due a while ago). Because I do note I'm getting less patient towards the end...
