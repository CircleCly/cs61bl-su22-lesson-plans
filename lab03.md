<ins>Before your section</ins>  
  
**What are the learning goals of the discussion section or lab?**  

To introduce students to conditionals, loops, and arrays.
  
**Which topic do you predict will be the most difficult for the students to learn?**  

I think the ``System.arraycopy`` for arrays may be very confusing for students, since it has
a lot of arguments to fill out.
  
**What is one thing about your teaching that you want to focus on during this class?**  

I would still focus on drawing parallels between Java and Python - help them see how Java syntax
is just slightly different from Python
  
**What activities will you do during class? (e.g. Group work? Pair work? Lecture? Physical demo?)**  

Mini-lectures, Q&A, and then hop off into pair/individual lab work.
  
<ins>Immediately after your section</ins>  
  
**First things first I’m the realest**  
  
**What went really well today? :)**  

I think my illustration of the ``System.arraycopy`` was very effective - I did code demo to show
how the method worked and the students grasped the intricacies of the method.

Also the problem examples I chose were quite effective for testing student understandings, and also improved student participation.
Students were very comfortable answering questions and asking questions.
  
**What didn’t go so well?**

In the beginning of the lecture when I asked for questions I didn't give the students enough time to ponder and type their questions, so their questions came out after I moved on. In later labs I'll try to give more time for students to type their questions.
  
**Presentation**  
  
Did you:

*   speak in a clear voice that could be easily heard?
*   write clearly?
*   listen carefully to students’ comments and questions without interrupting?
*   appear confident?
*   appear enthusiastic?
*   provide clear explanations?
*   explain terminology?

  
**Ideas for improving your presentation:**  

Today I think I spoke slower and with more confidence. I think I just need to keep up.
  
**Classroom Climate**  
  
Did you:

*   address students of all genders equally?
*   address students of different ethnic groups equally?
*   address shy and forthcoming students equally?
*   feel like students were generally happy (e.g. no angry students)?
*   take the time to learn your students’ names?

  
**Ideas for improving the classroom climate:**  

This wasn't an issue.
  
**Student Participation**  

*   Are students comfortable interacting with you?
*   Are the students comfortable interacting with each other?
*   How often were you talking versus the students?
*   Did you encourage the students to ask questions?
*   Are students comfortable asking “stupid” questions?
*   Were you happy with how long it took for students to answer your questions?
*   Did the students seem interested and engaged?

  
**Ideas for improving student participation:**  

Many students were eager to participate in mini-lecture QA, and they were also comfortable asking
questions. I'll keep it up.
  
**Focusing on Students**  
  
Did you:

*   try to answer a student’s question with a question?
*   try to find out what the students knew before giving an explanation?
*   provide explanations to address both struggling and excelling students?
*   feel like students understood your explanations?
*   feel like students, in general, really understand with the material?

  
**Ideas for tailoring your teaching to the needs of your students:**  

Wait for longer at the "any questions" phase!
  
**Lab/1-on-1 Interactions**  
  
You may skip any questions that are not applicable.  

*   What fraction of students did you interact with?

Most

*   Did you interact with the shy students?

Yes.

*   Did you refrain from assuming manual control of the keyboard?

Yes.

  
**Ideas to improve 1-on-1 interactions:**  

Keep up the asking of guiding questions and actively listening to students!
